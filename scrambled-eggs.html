    <h2>Scrambled eggs that will melt in your mouth.</h2>
    <p> Scrambled eggs are a simple recipe but will soon become an every day part of your life due to their ease.</p>
    <p>Best served with <strong>Ketchup</strong> or <strong>Brown Sauce.</strong></p>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
   <li>2 large free range eggs</li>
   <li>6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk</li>
   <li>a knob of butter</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Lightly whisk 2 large eggs, 6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk and a pinch of salt together until the mixture has just one consistency.</li>
    <li>Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add a knob of butter and let it melt. Donâ€™t allow the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs.</li>
    <li>Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting and folding it over from the bottom of the pan.</li>
    <li>Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again.</li>
    <li>Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat and leave for a moment to finish cooking.</li>
    <li>Give a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay.</li>
