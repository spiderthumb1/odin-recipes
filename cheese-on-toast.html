    <h2>It's time to get involved with this British classic.</h2>
    <p>Perhaps the most simplistic recipe on this website, it is thought that cheese on toast originated during the ending years of World War II, when oven use was beginning to really take off.</p>
    <p>Best served with <strong>Lee and Perrins Sauce</strong> or <strong>Ketchup.</strong></p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>A mix of cheeses</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Dried oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Broil the bread 1-2 minutes each side.</li>
        <li>Add all of the toppings at once.</li>
        <li>Broil it again for a further 1-2 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> And that is that! This can now be enjoyed on its own or with some nice hot soup.</p>
